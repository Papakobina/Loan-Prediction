# Loan-Prediction
<li>This is a machine learning module implemented with both decision tree and random forest algorithms</li>
<li>The aim of this module is to accurately predict the probability  of individuals paying off their loan</li>
<li>Based on the confusion matrix and classification report it is evident that the random forest algorithm as expected performs better</li>
